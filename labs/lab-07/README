Run `make`. `Make help` should help enlighten you on the commands available to you. Testing via the Makefile does work and most compilation should too.

Note that the resulting binary can be found in ./target/release/<name>. This is to ensure `make clean` does not remove the source files, as previous versions of my makefiles did.

This project is (in my humble opinion) simple, well-organized, and written to the best of my ability. I really like that in this class, common utilities in an computer system is constructed and designed from the ground up albeit by abstracting basic functionality in syscalls. I look forward to implementing my own syscalls in Operating Systems, but its nice now to be equipped with the tools needed to build my own developer tools from "scratch". Its also nice to see the pieces come together for the shell project now, as its just tryit + parsing inputs + non-determinant buffered inputs + managing pipelines
